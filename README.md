# Comics Library Project

## Introduction
This project is a long overdue attempt to stretch my software developer muscles. 
The project is simple: create a Library Management system for my comic books.
To do so, a database will be created to store information about my comic books. This will include information like comic book titles, publisher name, artist and writer names, etc.
This project will be accompanied by a basic frontend which will help the user enter information about their comic book.
